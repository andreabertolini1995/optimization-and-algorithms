# Transferring a robot

How should we act on a robot so that it transfers from a given position to another desired position?
We solve three separate variations of this basic question:
* How should we act on the robot—using simple control signals—so that the
robot also passes, as close as possible, to certain intermediate points along its journey? ([Task 1](https://github.com/andreabertolini1995/robot-transferring-problem/blob/main/task1.m), [task 2](

* How should we act on the robot—using simple control signals—so that the
robot also passes, as close as possible, to certain intermediate regions along its journey?
* How should we act on the robot so that it also passes exactly on as many intermediate points as possible?
