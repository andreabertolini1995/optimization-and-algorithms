# Transferring a robot

How should we act on a robot so that it transfers from a given position to another desired position?
We solve three separate variations of this basic question:
* How should we act on the robot—using simple control signals—so that the
robot also passes, as close as possible, to certain intermediate points along its journey?
* How should we act on the robot—using simple control signals—so that the
robot also passes, as close as possible, to certain intermediate regions along its journey?
* How should we act on the robot so that it also passes exactly on as many intermediate points as possible?
